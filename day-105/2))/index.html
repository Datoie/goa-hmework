<!-- HW #2 Objective: To create a JavaScript class Languages that represents a database of programming languages.
     Each programming language should be represented as an object with attributes like name, creator, year, and a brief description.

Requirements:

Create a class called Languages that will serve as the programming languages database.

Implement a method within the Languages class to add a new programming language to the database.
 This method should take parameters for the name, creator, year, and description of the language 
 and create a new language object. The method should then add this object to the database.

Implement a method to retrieve information about a specific programming language by name. This
 method should take the name of the language as a parameter and return the details (name, creator,
  year, description) of that language.

Implement a class method within the Languages class to list all the programming languages in the
 database, displaying their names in alphabetical order.

Create an instance of the Languages class and add at least five different programming languages to
 the database.

Demonstrate the use of your Languages class by adding, retrieving, and listing programming languages
 in a JavaScript program. -->
