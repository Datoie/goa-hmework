/*HW #2 Task: Extend 
the Rectangle class to create a Square class. The Square class only needs 
one side length (as opposed to width and height). Ensure that you can still
calculate area and perimeter for the square. HW */

/*#3 Task: Create a class 
Library and a class Book. The Library class should have a property that is
an array of Book objects. Implement methods in the Library class to add books,
remove books, and find books by title or author. HW #4 Create a new 
JavaScript file named circle.js Create a class named Circle The class 
should have two properties: Pi: This should be a static property with
a value of 3.14159. (You can use the built-in Math.PI for a more accurate
value if desired.) radius: This should be a dynamic property initialized
through the constructor. The constructor of the Circle class should accept
one parameter, radius. Ensure that the radius is positive. If a negative
radius or zero is provided, throw an error with a relevant message. area():
This method should return the area of the circle. Formula: Pi * radius^2.
perimeter(): This method should return the perimeter (circumference)
of the circle. Formula: 2 * Pi * radius.*/
