<!-- Create an Object: Declare an empty object named person.

Add Properties: Add properties name, age, and email to the person object with values of your choice.

Access Property: Access and log the name property of the person object.

Modify Property: Change the age property of the person object to a new value.

Add Method: Add a method called introduce to the person object that logs a greeting message with the person’s name and age.

Nested Objects: Create an object called address with properties street, city, and postalCode. Add this as a property of the person object.

Access Nested Property: Access and log the city property within the address object.

Object Comparison: Create two objects, person1 and person2, with the same properties and values. Check if they are equal.

Object Iteration: Create a function that loops through and logs all properties and their values of the person object.

Object Deletion: Remove the email property from the person object.

Object Length: Write a function that counts and logs the number of properties in the person object.

Object Keys: Write a function that logs all the keys (property names) of the person object.

Object Values: Write a function that logs all the values of the properties in the person object. Function Declaration: Declare a function named greet that logs “Hello, world!” when called.

Function Expression: Create a variable sayHi and assign it a function expression that logs “Hi there!” when called.

Function Parameters: Write a function called add that takes two parameters, a and b, and returns their sum.

Function Invocation: Call the add function from exercise 3 with arguments 7 and 3, and log the result.

Function Scope: Declare a variable x inside a function. Try to log the value of x outside of that function. What does it log?

Arrow Function Exercises:

Arrow Function Basics: Create an arrow function called double that takes a number as a parameter and returns its double.

Arrow Function with Implicit Return: Refactor the greet function from exercise 1 using an arrow function with an implicit return.

Arrow Function in Object: Create an object person with an arrow function property sayHello that logs “Hello!” when called. default values in function -->
